Hello World. I am Shubham, a techie, security enthusiast and if you wonder 'who the heck is this guy', you can know more about me on the [About Me](/about/) page. Well, you can read that either way.. 

Anyway, I just came out of Hibernate mode in terms of writing blogs. It has been too long planning to document those interesting case studies or crazy findings that I came across in last few years, but Long live Lazyness. ;)

Now since we have started, let's be positive and talk about what is going to be on this blog. I plan to write blogs around the areas I mostly work on, i.e. Defensive Security, Penetration Testing, Post Exploitation and Open Source Intelligence, random python scripts to automate things and try to make lives easier. 

And yeah, In case I come accross some breath taking view of a river, loved the endless sound of waves at some beach, or got lost in curvy mountains and the depth of the valleys, or jumped from the sky, expect a random blog (or may be more) on my travel adventure stories as well. :D 

Cheers.
